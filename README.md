## Description

This search engine will render a single page application (SPA) with the search results of books. There is a description of the books and you have the option to sign in and/or up to be an user. Once you are an user, you will have an option to save books to a list and remove books from your liked page.

### Motivation for creating this project

I built this application because I wanted to use the Apollo Studio Explorer interface paird with the GraphQL queries and Mutations. This was a challenging project but I learned a lot about developing application through the MERN stack.

### What problem does this solve?

This application will let users search and save books that they would like to read eventually. It gives a description of all of the books rendered on the page so you can find a book that sounds appealing to you.

## Installation
